1. The linux file system follows a tree structure. The root directory/folder is the foundation of every other directory. 
2. The home directory is one of the most important directories that are descendants of the root directory. 
3. Commands: 
	-->pwd: print working directory. A path that starts at the root directory all the way to current location is known as a "base path".
	-->ls: short for list. Lists out directory contents. Does not accept standard input. Requires command line arguments. 
		-->ls -F: Gives all the current files/folders
		-->ls -l: Gives the long form of all current folders/files
		-->ls -lh: Gives the long form but with human readability
4. When ls -F is called, the listed names that end in "/" are folders and the ones that don't are files. 
5. [cd command] --> This command means change directory. Can use "~" to get home directory. Can use this to quickly change locations in the directory. 
6. [a command] --> This command allows you to see all the files in a directory, even the hidden files.
