1. [Data Structure] a collection of data.
2. [Arrays] are ordered collections of values. Examples: list of comments on IG post, collection of levels in a game, songs on a playlist. 
3. Array structure example: let students = [];
4. Arrays are ordered. Can add any type of data in the array. It doesn't need to be homogenous. Can have booleans, strings, NaN, etc. 
5. Arrays are [indexed], just like strings. The length of an array is always one greater than the maximum index. You can change the items in an array whereas strings cannot be changed. 
6. [Array Methods]
	-->Push - add to end
	-->Pop - remove from end
	-->Shift - remove from start
	-->Unshift - add to start
	-->concat - merge arrays
	-->includes - look for a value
	-->indexOf - just like string.indexOf
	-->join - creates a string from an array
	-->reverse - reverses an array (it does change the original)
	-->slice - copies a portion on an array
	-->splice - removes/replaces elements
	-->sort - sorts and array
7. Arrays do not have a limited memory per se. What arrays store is a "reference" in memory. Therefore it does not care about the content of the array. The memory used is referring to the array itself. Not the contents of the array. 
8. [const] variables are commonly used with arrays because the reference to array doesn't change but the contents of the array could be changed.
