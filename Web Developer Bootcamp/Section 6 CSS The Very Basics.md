1. CSS --> It allows us to style and change our visual representation on the webpage. Whenever you write CSS, you are writing CSS rules. 
2. Options for writing CSS code:
	--> Inline styles where you write directly inline with each element. Not recommended normally. 
	--> The <style> element allows you to write your style inside an element but but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents. Also not recommended. 
	--> External stylesheet allows you to write your styles in a .css file and then include the using a <link> in the head of your html document. Recommended!
3. <color> --> The color property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations and sets the currentcolor value. It changes the text color. 
	--> background-color sets the background color of an element.
4. All browsers recognize 140 colors. 
5. rgb is red, green, and blue and 255 is the maxed out version. You can add different amounts for all of them. Example: rgb(255,0,0) --> red, OR rgb (0,0,255)--> blue, OR rgb (0,255,0) --> green. You can mix and match the saturation. 
6. Hexidecimal is another way to represent colors. It is based on the red, green, and blue channels. Each one ranges from 0-255 as well but is represented by hexadecimal. It has 16 choices and we use ABCDEF. F=15 in hex. #ffff00 --> red, green, blue. Must have a '#' to show we are indicated a hex number. Hex is used more commonly than rgb.
