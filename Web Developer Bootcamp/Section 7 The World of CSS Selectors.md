1. CSS Selectors
2. The universal selector "* " selects all of something. Example: * { background-color: cyan; }. Not commonly used.
3. The element selector selects everything of a given type. Example: button { font-size: 30px}.
4. The selector list allows you to use a comma to combine multiple selectors in a list. Example: h1, h2 {color: magenta;}
5. The id selector can be used for any element to single out a specific "hook" for CSS to use. Example: <button id="signup">Sign Up</button>. To call this id/"hook" for CSS, you need to use "#". Example: #signup{background-color: blue;}
6. The class selector is similar to id but it can be applied to multiple elements. Can grab multiple elements simultaneously
