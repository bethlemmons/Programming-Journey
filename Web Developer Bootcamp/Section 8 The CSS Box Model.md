1. The [Box Model] is essentially the idea that everything in CSS is a box.
		-->Content Box
		-->Padding
		-->Border
		-->Margin
2. [Width] & [Height] that sets the width and height of the inner content area. 
3. [Border] is the property that is around an element. It can be short-handed so you put all the information in one line instead of multiple lines. The order is: width, style, color. 
		-->Border-Width
		-->Border-Color
		-->Border-Style
