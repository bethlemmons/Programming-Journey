1. [Comparison Operators]
	--> ">" greater than
	--> "<" less than
	--> ">=" greater than or equal
	--> "== " equality
	--> "!=" not equal
	--> "=== " strict equality
	--> "!== " strict non-equality
2. "== " checks for equality of value, but equality of type. It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them. 
3.  "=== " does NOT coerces values to be the same type. 
4.  The above is also true for "!= " and "!== " 
5.  [console.log()] prints arguments to the console. In other languages it is "print".
6.  [alert] is a method that prints something out to the user. 
7.  [prompt] is a method that accepts an argument. The user input is usually saved to a variable. 
8.  [Conditionals]
