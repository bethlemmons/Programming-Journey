1. [Comparison Operators]
	--> ">" greater than
	--> "<" less than
	--> ">=" greater than or equal
	--> "== " equality
	--> "!=" not equal
	--> "=== " strict equality
	--> "!== " strict non-equality
2. "== " checks for equality of value, but equality of type. It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them. 
3.  "=== " does NOT coerces values to be the same type. 
4.  The above is also true for "!= " and "!== " 
5.  [console.log()] prints arguments to the console. In other languages it is "print".
6.  [alert] is a method that prints something out to the user. 
7.  [prompt] is a method that accepts an argument. The user input is usually saved to a variable. 
8.  [Conditionals]
	--> [if statement] only runs the code if the given condition is true
	-->[else if] if not the first thing, maybe this other thing. You can have as many else-if statements as needed. Sequential. 
	-->[else] if nothing else was true, do this. 
9. [Nesting] You can nest conditionals inside of other conditionals. 
10. [Falsy Values]
	-->false
	-->0
	-->"" (empty string)
	-->null
	-->undefined
	-->NaN
11. [Logical Operators] combining expressions.
	--> && : And 
	--> || : Or
	--> ! : Not
12. [&&] This is logical AND and means that both sides must be true for the entire thing to be true. 
13. [||] OR: if one side is true, the entire thing is true. 
14. [!] NOT: expression that returns true if the expression is false. 
15. [switch] the switch statement is another control-flow statement that can replace multiple if statements.
