1. [Primitive Types in JS] :
	-->Number: JS has one number type, positive/negative, whole, decimal. Nan --> Not A Number: is considered a number but is not a number. None(?)
	-->String
	-->Boolean
	-->Null
	-->Undefined
2. [Variables] : labels for values
	--> Syntax: let name = value; 
	--> Can use +=, -=, --, ++ to add or subtract from the variable by various increments.
	--> const: works just like let but you cannot change the value
	--> var: the old variable keyword works similarly to let. should use let exclusively
3. [Booleans] : true or false
4. Variables can change types. Can move a number variable to a boolean. 
5. Variable naming rules and conventions for JS:
		-->no spaces
		-->can use numbers but can't start with a digit
		-->case sensitive
		-->most common to use camel casing
		-->use descriptive names
