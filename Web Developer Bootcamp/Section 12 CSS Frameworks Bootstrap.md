	--> Responsive images: the class="img-fluid" creates images that are responsive to size. It scales with the parent element. 
11. [Helper Classes used in Bootstrap]
	-->align-items-end: sets all the items in that class to align at the bottom or end of the longest item. Can use start/center/end.

	-->navbar brand: 
	-->collapse: allows you to collapse something. But must add an expand as well.
