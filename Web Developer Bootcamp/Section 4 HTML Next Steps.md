### Section 4
1. Inline elements fit in alongside other elements.
2. Block level elements take up a whole "block" of space. 
3. The content division element <div> is a block level element. It allows for you to block the content together to treat it similarly. 
4. The <span> element allows you to wrap around a specific word/area that allows you to manipulate the content with CSS. They are inline elements. 
5. The horizontal rule element <hr> does not have a closing tag. It creates a visible line going across the page. It can be styled. 
6. The line break element <br> is not commonly used but can be used to for line breaks within a paragraph.
7. The superscript element <sup></sup> allows you to make something superscript. An example would be inline citation.
8. Like the element above, the subscript element <sub></sub> allows you to create a script underneath. An example would be H20. Combined they make fractions. 
9. HMTL Entities all start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. They are used in place of difficult to type characters. The browser interprets them and redners the correct character instead. Look up the entitycode for the symbol you need. 
10. Semantic markup --> Related to meaning. This is basically making sure that your code is easily readable.
 11. Elements to use besides divs:
	--> <section>
	--> <article>
	--> <nav>
	--> <main>
	--> <header>
	--> <footer>
	--> <aside>
	--> <summary> 
	--> <details>
