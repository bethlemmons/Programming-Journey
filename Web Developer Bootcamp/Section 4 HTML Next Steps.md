### Section 4
1. Inline elements fit in alongside other elements.
2. Block level elements take up a whole "block" of space. 
3. The content division element <div> is a block level element. It allows for you to block the content together to treat it similarly. 
4. The <span> element allows you to wrap around a specific word/area that allows you to manipulate the content with CSS. They are inline elements. 
5. The horizontal rule element <hr> does not have a closing tag. It creates a visible line going across the page. It can be styled. 
6. The line break element <br> is not commonly used but can be used to for line breaks within a paragraph.
7. The superscript element <sup></sup> allows you to make something superscript. An example would be inline citation.
8. Like the element above, the subscript element <sub></sub> allows you to create a script underneath. An example would be H20. Combined they make fractions. 
9. HMTL Entities all start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. They are used in place of difficult to type characters. The browser interprets them and redners the correct character instead. Look up the entitycode for the symbol you need. 
10. Semantic markup --> Related to meaning. This is basically making sure that your code is easily readable.
 11. Elements to use besides divs:
	--> <section> --> Represents a standalone section of a page/website. 
	--> <article> --> Self contained composition in a document. Independently usable or distributable. 
	--> <nav> --> Anything on the page that provides navigation links. 
	--> <main> --> The dominant content of a page. 
	--> <header> --> Introductory content. Often navigational content as well. 
	--> <footer> --> The bottom of the document. 
	--> <aside> --> A portion of the document that is only indirectly related to the document. 
	--> <summary> 
	--> <details> 
12. Shortcut for copying a line is: shift + alt + up/down arrow key. 
13. Shortcut for overall html document layout: ! + tab. 
14. Shortcut for nested items: main>section>h1 + tab. 
15. Shortcut for non-nested items: h1 + h2 + h3 + tab. 
16. Multiplication allows you to copy a bunch of elements at once: ul>li*4
17. Shortcut for numbering: ul>li.item$*5
