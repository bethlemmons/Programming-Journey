## HTML

1. Headings ( <h1></h1> ) can go from h1-h6 and are meaningful. You should not have an h4 without an h1-h3. Only one h1 per page. 
2. HTML Boilerplate (skeleton). 
3. <!DOCTYPE html> indicates to browser that it is using HTML 5. 
4. <html> element is also known as the root element. Every element should be within this tag.
