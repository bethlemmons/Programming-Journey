1. "if" statements --> a conditional test that allows you to examine the current state of thge program and respond appropriately. 
2. ==  --> equality operator. 
3. "!=" --> The does not equal operator. 
4. "and/or" statements --> If the conditional "and" is in an expression, than BOTH conditions must be met to be true. if the conditional "or" is in an expression, than EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER expression must be met to be true. 
5. "in"	--> a keyword that checks if a list contains a specific values.
6. "not" --> a keyword that verifies that the list does not contain a specific value. 
7. "if-else" statements --> allow you to evaluate a condition to something other than just a boolean. Is good for situations that evaluate to an either/or solution.
8. "if-elif-else" statements --> This allows for more than two possible solutions but will stop running if one of the conditions is met before running through the other conditions. 
9. You can create your own alias's for commands. This allows you to essentially shorthand common commands that you use in Linux. Need to use a ".bash_aliases" to title the file in order for it to be hidden. EXAMPLE: alias aliasName="command1 -options args | command2 -options args ..."
