##### Notes
1) for loop --> A controlled flow statement that is used repeatedly to execute a group of statements as long as the the conditions are satisified. 
2) range() function --> Returns a sequence of numbers. It can skip numbers by adding a third number to the given range. 
3) list comprehension --> Provides a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. (ex cube_comprehension = [value**3 for value in range(1, 11)])
