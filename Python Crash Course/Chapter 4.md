### Chapter 4
##### Notes
1) for loop --> A controlled flow statement that is used repeatedly to execute a group of statements as long as the the conditions are satisified. 
2) #range() function --> Returns a sequence of numbers. It can skip numbers by adding a third number to the given range. 
3) #list comprehension --> Provides a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. (ex cube_comprehension = [value**3 for value in range(1, 11)])
4) #slice() --> A specific group of items in a list ([:])
5) You can easily make a #copy of a list using the slice method to duplicate the list. (ex: my_pizza = friends_pizza[:])
6) [[tuples]] --> Tuples are an immutable list. It is a simple data structure to be used when you don't want the items in your list to change. Tuples are written using parentheses '()' .
