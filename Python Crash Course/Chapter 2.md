### Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
##### Notes
1) #Variable --> A variable holds a value that is the information associated with that specific variable. 
2) #Method --> A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. It sometimes is proceeded by a dot (.) and is followed by parentheses. 
3) #String --> A string is a data type. It is a a series of characters within quotations. (Various methods for changing the case of the string include: .upper(), .lower(), .title())
4) Methods for handling whitespace are: 
			a. \t --> tab length
			b. \n --> new line
			c. rstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the right
			d. lstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the left
			e. strip() --> remove extra whitespace from both sides simultaneously
5) #Syntax Error --> An error in the Python program that isn't recognized as valid code. 
6) #Float --> Any number with a decimal in it.
7) #Type Error --> Python can't recognize the kind of info you're using. 
8) str() function --> Any variable wrapped in this function will present as a string. 
9) The Zen of Python:
								Beautiful is better than ugly.
								Explicit is better than implicit.
								Simple is better than complex.
								Complex is better than complicated.
								Flat is better than nested.
								Sparse is better than dense.
								Readability counts.
								Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
								Although practicality beats purity.
								Errors should never pass silently.
								Unless explicitly silenced.
								In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
								There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
								Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
								Now is better than never.
								Although never is often better than *right* now.
								If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
								If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
								Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
