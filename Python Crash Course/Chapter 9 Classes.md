1. Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class. 
2. A function that is part of a class is a [method].
3. The [__init__()] method is a special method that python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the specified class. 
4. Variables that are accessible because a prefixed argument are called [attributes].
5. A class is a set of instructions for how to make an instance.
