1. Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class. 
2. A function that is part of a class is a [method].
3. The [__init__()] method is a special method that python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the specified class. 
4. Variables that are accessible because a prefixed argument are called [attributes].
5. A class is a set of instructions for how to make an instance. 
6. [Inheritance] when one class inherits from another, it automatically takes on all the attributes and methods fo the first class. The original class is called the parent class and the new class is called the child class. 
7. [the super() function] is a special function that helps Python make connections between the parent and child class.  Parent/Child. Superclass/Subclass.
