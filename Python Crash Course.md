### Chapter 1: Getting Started
##### Notes
[Python website](https://www.python.org/)

If I had infinite skills, I would create a personal health information blockchain that would enable individuals to control their health history. It would be simple and intuitive to use, utilizing QR codes for data uploading and accessing. People would be able to access and share specific results or reports without difficulty. Physicians would be able to read the entire history of the patient without critical information missing. Patients would not need repeat testing because their doctor's office is closed. If individuals wanted to sell their health history for research, it would be scrubbed of personally identifying information and they could support causes or earn rewards. Individuals would own their information and no longer be hapless patients in the maelstorm of the health industry. 

### Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
##### Notes
1) Variable --> A variable holds a value that is the information associated with that specific variable. 
2) Method --> A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. It sometimes is proceeded by a dot (.) and is followed by parentheses. 
3) String --> A string is a data type. It is a a series of characters within quotations. (Various methods for changing the case of the string include: .upper(), .lower(), .title())
4) Methods for handling whitespace are: 
			a. \t --> tab length
			b. \n --> new line
			c. rstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the right
			d. lstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the left
			e. strip() --> remove extra whitespace from both sides simultaneously
5) Syntax Error --> An error in the Python program that isn't recognized as valid code. 
6) Float --> Any number with a decimal in it.
7) Type Error --> Python can't recognize the kind of info you're using. 
8) str() function --> Any variable wrapped in this function will present as a string. 
9) The Zen of Python:
								Beautiful is better than ugly.
								Explicit is better than implicit.
								Simple is better than complex.
								Complex is better than complicated.
								Flat is better than nested.
								Sparse is better than dense.
								Readability counts.
								Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
								Although practicality beats purity.
								Errors should never pass silently.
								Unless explicitly silenced.
								In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
								There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
								Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
								Now is better than never.
								Although never is often better than *right* now.
								If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
								If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
								Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
	
	

### Chapter 3
##### Notes

1) List [] --> A list is an ordered collection of items/elements. 
2) Index --> Refers to the location of an item/element within a list. 
3) .append() --> A method that allows you to add additional items/elements to the end of the list.
4) .insert() --> A method that allows you to insert additional items/elements within a specific location in the list index.   
5) del statement (ex. del motorcycles[0]) --> A statement that allows you to remove a value from a specific location in the list index. 
6) pop() method --> A method that allows you to remove a value/item from the end of a list while still being able to manipulate that item/value. 
7) remove() method --> A method that allows you to remove an item/value if you know the name of the item/value but not it's specific location within the list index. You are able to manipulate this value/item once removed. 
8) sort() method --> Permanently sorts lists alphabetically. 
9) (reverse=True) --> Temporarily reverse alphabetically sorts lists. 
10) sorted() function --> Temporarily sorts lists alphabetically. 
11) reverse() method --> Permanently reverse alphabetically sorts lists. 
12) len() method --> Determines the length of the list.
