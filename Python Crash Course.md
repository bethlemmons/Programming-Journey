If I had infinite skills, I would create a personal health information blockchain that would enable individuals to control their health history. It would be simple and intuitive to use, utilizing QR codes for data uploading and accessing. People would be able to access and share specific results or reports without difficulty. Physicians would be able to read the entire history of the patient without critical information missing. Patients would not need repeat testing because their doctor's office is closed. If individuals wanted to sell their health history for research, it would be scrubbed of personally identifying information and they could support causes or earn rewards. Individuals would own their information and no longer be hapless patients in the maelstorm of the health industry. 

### Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
##### Notes
1) Variable --> A variable holds a value that is the information associated with that specific variable. 
2) Method --> A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. It sometimes is proceeded by a dot (.) and is followed by parentheses. 
3) String --> A string is a data type. It is a a series of characters within quotations. (Various methods for changing the case of the string include: .upper(), .lower(), .title())
4) Methods for handling whitespace are: 
			a. \t --> tab length
			b. \n --> new line
			c. rstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the right
			d. lstrip() --> remove extra whitespace to the left
			e. strip() --> remove extra whitespace from both sides simultaneously
5) Syntax Error --> An error in the Python program that isn't recognized as valid code.
