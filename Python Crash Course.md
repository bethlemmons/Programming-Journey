If I had infinite skills, I would create a personal health information blockchain that would enable individuals to control their health history. It would be simple and intuitive to use, utilizing QR codes for data uploading and accessing. People would be able to access and share specific results or reports without difficulty. Physicians would be able to read the entire history of the patient without critical information missing. Patients would not need repeat testing because their doctor's office is closed. If individuals wanted to sell their health history for research, it would be scrubbed of personally identifying information and they could support causes or earn rewards. Individuals would own their information and no longer be hapless patients in the maelstorm of the health industry.
